Variables
    - The available types are numbers, strings, Booleans, functions, and objects
        - also have undefined and null, along with arrays, dates, and regular expressions
    - It is not a strongly typed language such as C/C++, C# or Java
        - In Java, we declare variables along with its type
        - In Java, we use the keyword var, and do not need to declare the variable type
    - Since, JS is not strongly typed language, we are able to declare a variable, initialize it
      with a number and update it with a string or any other datatype
        - Assigning a value to a variable that is different from its original type is not a good
          practice
    - 'null' value means no value
    - 'undefined' means a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value
