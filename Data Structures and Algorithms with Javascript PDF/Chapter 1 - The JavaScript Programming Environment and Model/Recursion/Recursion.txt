Recursion
    - When a function is called recursively, the results of the function's computation are temporarily suspended while the recursion is in progress
    - JS is capable of handling fairly deep recursive calls,
        - When an algorithm requires a deeper recursive call than JS can handle, we will pursue an iterative solution
    - Any function that uses recursion and be rewritten in an iterative manner
