Declaring and Initializing Variables
    - Variables are global by default
        - when a variable is initialized without first being declared, it becomes a global variable
        - We will follow the convention of declaring variables
            - This will create variables that are local scope
    - Use the var keyword followed by a variable name
        var number;
        var name;
        var rate = 1.2;
        var greeting = "Hello, world!";
        var flag = false;
