Decision Constructs
    - Allows our program to make decisions on what programming statements to execute based on a boolean expression
    - The 2 kinds covered here are
        - 'if' statement
        - 'switch' statement

    - 'if' statement comes in three forms
        - 'if'
        - 'if-else'
        - 'if-else if'

    - 'switch' statement
        - The switch statement compares the input with all of the 'case' statents
            - If a 'case' matches the input
                - The code in the case block will execute
            - If the case block does not have a 'break' statement
                - The code right below our case block will also execute
