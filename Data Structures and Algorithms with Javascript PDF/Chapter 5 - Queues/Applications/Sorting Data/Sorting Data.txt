Sorting Data with Queues
    - Queues can also be used to sort data
    - In the old days of computing, programs were entered into a mainframe program via punch cards
        - Each of the card holds a single program statement
        - The cards were sorting using a mechanical sorter that utilized bin-link structures to hold
          cards
    - We can simulate this process by using a set of queues
        - This sorting technique is called a radix sort
            - It is not the fastest of sorting algorithms but it demonstrate an interesting use of queues
    - The radix sort works by making two passes over a data set
        - Our data set in this case is a set of integers from 0 to 99
        - The first pass sorts the numbers based on the 1s digit
        - Then second pass sorts the number based on the 10s digit
            - Each number is placed in a bin based on the digit in each of these 2 places
            - Example: 91, 46, 85, 15, 92, 35, 31, 22
                - The first pass of the radix sort results in the configuration
                    Bin 0:
                    Bin 1: 91, 31
                    Bin 2: 92, 22
                    Bin 3:
                    Bin 4:
                    Bin 5: 85, 15, 35
                    Bin 6: 46
                    Bin 7:
                    Bin 8:
                    Bin 9:
                - The numbers are not sorted based on which bin they are in:
                    91, 31, 92, 22, 85, 15, 35, 46
                - Then second pass sorts by the 10s digit into the appropriate bins
                    Bin 0:
                    Bin 1: 15
                    Bin 2: 22
                    Bin 3: 31, 35
                    Bin 4: 46
                    Bin 5:
                    Bin 6:
                    Bin 7:
                    Bin 8: 85
                    Bin 9: 91, 92
                - If we take our all the numbers from our bins and put them back in a list, we have
                    15, 22, 31, 35, 46, 85, 91, 92
    - We can implement this algorithm by using a queue to represent bins
        - We need 9 queues, one for each digit
        - All the queues will be stored in an array
    - We use the modulus and integer division to determine the 1s and 10s digit
    - The Algorithm entails adding numbers to their approapriate queue, taking the numbers our of the queues to
      resort them based on the 1s digit, and then repeating the process for the 10s digit
