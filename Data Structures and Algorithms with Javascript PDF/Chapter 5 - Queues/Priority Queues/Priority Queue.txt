Priority Queue
    - In normal queue operations, when an element is removed from a queue, the element is always
      the first element that was inserted into the queue
    - There are certain situations, where the elements removed in an order other than first-in, first-out
        - We need to create a data structure called a priority queue
        - Each of the elemnts are removed from the queue based on a priority constraint
    - For example:
        - Waiting room at a hospital's emergency department (ED) operates using a priority queue
            - When a patient enters the ED, he or she is sheen by a nurse
                - This nurse's job is to assess the severity of the patient's condition and assign a
                  priority code to the patient
                - Patients with a high priority code are seen before patients with a lower priority code
                - Patients that have the same priority code are seen on a first-come, first-served basis
