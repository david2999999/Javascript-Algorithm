Queues
    - A type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front
    - It is used to store data in the order in which they occur
        - We can think of a queue like the line at our banks
            - The first person into the line is the first person served
            - As more customers enter a line, they wait in the back until it is their turn to be served
    - First-in, first-our (FIFO) data structure

Applications
    - Order processes submitted to an operating system or print spooler
    - Model scenarios such as customers standing in the line at a bank or a grocery store

Operations
    - Two primary operations involves inserting new element and removing an element from a queue
        - Insertion operation is called 'enqueue', this inserts a new element at the end of the queue
        - Removal operation is called 'dequeue', this removes an element from the front of a queue
    - Another important queue operation is viewing the element at the front of a queue
        - Peek operation returns the element stored at the front of the queue without removing it from the queue
    - Other utility methods/properties include
        - length property
        - clear() operation
