Arrays
    - A linear collection of elements, where the elements can be accessed via indices
        - The indices are usually integers used to compute offsets
    - The array used in JS is actually a specialized type of object, with indices being property names that can be integers used to represent offsets
        - When integers are used for indices, they are converted to strings internally in order to conform to the requirements for JS objects
        - Since JS arrays are just objects, they are not quite as efficient as the arrays of other programming languages
    - The Array is one of the recognized JS object types, and there is a set of properties and functions you can use with arrays

Using Arrays
    - Arrays in JS are very flexible
        - There are many ways to create arrays, access array elements and perform task such as searching and sorting the elements
        - JS 1.5 allows developers to work with arrays using functional programming techniques
