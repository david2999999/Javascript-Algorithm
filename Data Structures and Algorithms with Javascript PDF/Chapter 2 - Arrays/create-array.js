// Simplest way to declare an array is using the [] operator
    var numbers = [];

// when we create an array in this manner, we will have an array with length of 0
    // this can be checked with the built-in length property
     console.log(numbers.length);

// Another way to create an array is to declare an array variable with a set of elements inside the [] operator
    var numbers2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    console.log(numbers2.length);
