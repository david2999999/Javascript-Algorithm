Dictionaries
    - Data structure that stores data as key-value pairs
        - Example: Phone book store its data as names and phone numbers
            - When we look for a phone number, we first search for the name
            - When we find the name, the phone number is found right next to the name
        - The key is the element you use to perform a search
        - The value is the result of the search
    - Javascript's Object class is designed to operate as a dictionary
    - We will use the features of the Object class to build a Dictionary class that simplified working
      with a dictionary-type object
        - Creating a Dictionary class allows encapsulation, such as the advantage of being able to
          define functions for performing collective operations
            - Such as displaying all entries in a dictionary, rather than having to write loops
              in the main program to perform the same operation
