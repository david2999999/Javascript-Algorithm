Lists
    - List are especially useful if we don't have to perform searches on the items in the list or put them
      in some type of sorted order
    - An ordered sequence of data, and each data item stored in a list is called element
        - The elements can be of any data type
    - There are no predetermined number of elements that can be stored in a list, although the practical limit
      will be the amount of memoy available to the program using the list
    - A list with no elements is an empty list
        - The number of elements stored in a list is called the length of the list
            - The number of elements is kept in a 'listSize' variable inside of the list ADT
    - List have properties to describe location
        - Front of a list and the end of a list
            - next(), prev(), moveTo(n) operations allows us to traverse the list
