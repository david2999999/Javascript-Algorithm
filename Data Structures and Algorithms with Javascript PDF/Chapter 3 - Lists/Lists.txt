Lists
    - List are especially useful if we don't have to perform searches on the items in the list or put them
      in some type of sorted order
    - An ordered sequence of data, and each data item stored in a list is called element
        - The elements can be of any data type
    - There are no predetermined number of elements that can be stored in a list, although the practical limit
      will be the amount of memoy available to the program using the list
    - A list with no elements is an empty list
        - The number of elements stored in a list is called the length of the list
            - The number of elements is kept in a 'listSize' variable inside of the list ADT
    - List have properties to describe location
        - Front of a list and the end of a list
            - next(), prev(), moveTo(n) operations allows us to traverse the list

    - We can perform many operations on the list such as
        - listSize (property)     Number of elements in list
        - pos (property)          Current position in list
        - length (property)       Returns the number of elements in list
        - clear (function)        Clears all elements from list
        - toString (function)     Returns string representation of list
        - getElement (function)   Returns element at current position
        - insert (function)       Inserts new element after existing element
        - append (function)       Adds new element to end of list
        - remove (function)       Removes element from list
        - front (function)        Sets current position to first element of list
        - end (function)          Sets current position to last element of list
        - prev (function)         Moves current position back one element
        - next (function)         Moves current position forward one element
        - currPos (function)      Returns the current position in list
        - moveTo (function)       Moves the current position to specified position
