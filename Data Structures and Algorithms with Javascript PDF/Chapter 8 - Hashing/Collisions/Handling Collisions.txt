Handling Collisions
    - A collision occurs when a hash function generates the same key for two or more values
        - The second part of a hash algorithm involves reolving collisions so that all keys
          are stored in the hash table
    - Two collision resolution are separate chaining and linear probing

Separate Chaining
    - When collision occurs, we still need to be able to store the key at the generated index,
      but it is physically impossible to store more than one piece of data in an array element
    - Separate chaining is a technique where each array element of a hash table stores another
      data structure
        - Such as another array, which is then used to store keys
            - Note: this approach is used for HashSets, not a HashMap
        - Using this technique, if two keys generate the same hash value, each key can be stored
          in a different position of the secondary array
    - To implement this feature
        - After we create the array to store the hashed keys, we call a function that assigns an empty
          array to each array element of the hash table
            - This creates a two-dimensional array
