Linear Probing
    - An example of a more general hashing technique called open-addressing hashing
    - When there is a collision, the program simply looks to see if the next element
      of the hash table is empty
        - If the element is not empty, the program continue to search for an empty
          hash-table element until one is found
        - This technique makes use of the fact that any hash table is going to have many
          empty elements and it makes sense to use the space to store keys.
    - Should be chosen over separate chaining when your array for storing data can be fairly
      large
    - The formula commonly used to determine which collision method to use
        - if the size of the array can be up to half the number of elements to be stored, you
          should use separate chaining
        - if the size of the array can be twice the size of the number of elements to be stored,
          you should use linear probing.
