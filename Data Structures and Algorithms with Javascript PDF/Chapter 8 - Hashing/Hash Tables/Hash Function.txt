Hash Functions
    - The choice of hash function depends on the data type of the key
        - if the key is an integer, then the simplest hash function is to return the key
           modulo the size of the array
           - There are circumstances when this function is not recommended, such as when all of the keys
             ends in 0 and the array size is 10
                - This is one reason the array size should always be a prime number
           - If the keys are random integers, this hash function should more evenly distribute the keys
           - This type of hashing is also known as modular hashing
