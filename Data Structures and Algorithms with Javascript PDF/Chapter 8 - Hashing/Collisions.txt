Collisions
    - To avoid collisions, we first need to make sure the array that we are using is sized to a prime number
        - This is necessary due to the use of modular arithmetic in computing the key
        - The size of the array needs to be greater than 100 in order to more evenly disperse the keys in the table
    - The next approach to avoiding collisions is to compute a better hash value
        - An algorithm known as the Horner's method
            - This hash function works by summing the ASCII values of the characters of a string, but it adds
              a step by multiplying the resulting total by a prime constant
