Shortcoming of Arrays
    - In many programming languages, arrays are fixed in length, so it is hard to add new data
      when the last element of the array is reached
    - Adding and removing data from an array is also difficult because you have to move array elements
      up or down to reflect either an addition or a deletion
        - these problems do not come up with Javascript arrays, since we an use the split() function
          without having to perform additional array element access
    - The main problem with JS arrays is that the array are implemented as objects, causing them to be
      less efficient than arrays built in languages such as C++ and Java

    - When the operations performed on an array is too slow for practical use, we can consider
        using linkedlist as an alternative data structure
    - The linked list can be used in almost every situation where a one-dimensional array is used,
        except for the case of random access
        - When random access is required, an array is the better data structure use
