Linked Lists
    - The linked list is a collection of objects called nodes
        - Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference
        - The reference to another node is called a link
    - While array elements are referenced by their position, linked list elements are
      referenced by their relationship to the other elements in the linked list
    - Iterating through a linked list involves following the links of the list from the beginning
      node to the end node
        - The node at the end of the linked list points to a null node
    - Many linked-list implementations include a special node, called the header or head node, to
      denote the beginning of a linked list
    - Inserting a new node into a linked list is a very efficient task
        - The linked of the node before the inserted node (the previous node) is changed to
          point to the new node
            - The new node's link is set to the node the previous node was pointing to before the
              insertion
    - Removing an item from a linked list is also efficient
        - The link of the node before the removed node is redirected to point to the node the removed
          node is point to, while also pointing the removed null to null
          - This will effectively take out the node out of the linked list
