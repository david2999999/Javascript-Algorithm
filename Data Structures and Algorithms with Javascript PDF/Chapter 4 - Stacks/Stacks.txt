Stacks
    - A list of elements that are only accessible only from one end of the list
        - which is called the top
    - A common real world example of a stack is the stack of trays at a cafeteria
        - Trays are removed from the top, and when trays are put back on the stack after
          they are washed, they are placed on the top of the stack
    - This ordering is known as last-in, first-out (LIFO)
        - Due to this ordering, any element that is not currently at the top of the stack can not
          be accessed
        - To get the element at the bottom of the stack, you have to dispose of all elements above it first
    - The basic operations of the stack are
        - Push() - adding element
        - Pop() - remove element
        - Peek() - viewing the element at the top of a stack
    - Other utility operations/properties include
        - clear() - remove all element from stack
        - length - holds the number of elements in the stack
        - isEmpty() - boolean indicating if the stack is empty or not
