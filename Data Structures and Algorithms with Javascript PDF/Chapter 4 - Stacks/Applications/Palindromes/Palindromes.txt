Palindrome
    - A word, phrase or number that is spelled the same forward and backward
    - We can use a stack to determine whether or not a given string is a palindrome
        - We take the original string and push each character onto a stack, moving left to right
        - When the end of the string is reached, the stack contains the original string in reverse order
            - We then simply compare the original string with the reversed work, and if they are equal, the
              string is a palindrome
